# Homework overview
This is my first homework assignment for this  bootcamp called Code Refactor. In this assignment I had to make code look more clean and accessible without changing what it does.

# what I did-:
* Gave it sections to make clear what is in the tags and make it more logical.
* Gave image elements alt attributes
* Gave it header and footer
* h tags in sequence
